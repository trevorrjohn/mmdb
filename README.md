# MaxMindDB

The purpose of this gem is to implement the [MaxMindDB File Format](http://maxmind.github.io/MaxMind-DB/) in Ruby. 

The gem is highly influenced by the implementation of the [MaxMindDB gem](https://github.com/yhirose/maxminddb) and I have to give a lot of credit to that project.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pure_mmdb'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pure_mmdb

## Usage

1. Configure the gem:

	```ruby
	Mmdb.configure do |c|
		c.file_path = '/path/to/db.mmdb'
	end
	```
1. Lookup IP's

	```ruby
	> Mmdb.lookup('192.168.1.1')
	#=> { "data" => "value" }
	```


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
